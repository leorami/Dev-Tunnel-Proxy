# Calliope Training Complete ‚úÖ

## Session Summary

This session successfully taught Calliope to detect, diagnose, and fix common proxy issues, with an emphasis on **IMMEDIATE ACTION** over explanation.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mixed Content Errors  
**Symptoms**: HTTPS page requesting HTTP resources, blocked by browser security  
**Root Cause**: nginx issuing HTTP URLs in redirects + X-Forwarded-Proto set to "http"  

**Fix Applied**:
- `config/default.conf`: Added `absolute_redirect off;` and `port_in_redirect off;`
- `apps/lyra.conf`: Changed `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto` from `$scheme` to `"https"`

**Test Results**: ‚úÖ 0 mixed content errors (was 9)

---

### 2. ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (Redirect Loops)
**Symptoms**: Assets fail to load, browser console shows infinite redirect loop  
**Root Cause**: nginx config had `proxy_pass http://lyra-dev:4000/lyra/_next/;` which caused redirects  

**Fix Applied**:
- `apps/lyra.conf`: Changed `proxy_pass` to `http://lyra-dev:4000;` (no trailing path)
- Regenerated nginx bundle with `node utils/generateAppsBundle.js`

**Test Results**: ‚úÖ Assets now load correctly (56KB webpack.js)

---

### 3. Calliope "Explaining" Instead of "Doing"
**Symptoms**: Calliope would say "Here's how I'll fix it..." but not actually fix anything  
**Root Cause**: AI responses are text-only; healing had to happen in backend BEFORE AI responds  

**Fix Applied**:
- `utils/proxyConfigAPI.js`: Added pattern detection for "mixed content", "redirect loop", "err_too_many_redirects"
- Backend now executes healing functions BEFORE sending AI response
- Updated Calliope's system prompt to emphasize immediate action

**Test Results**: ‚úÖ Calliope now fixes issues, then reports what was done

---

### 4. Calliope Not Diagnosing Before Healing
**Symptoms**: Calliope would apply generic healing even when app was healthy  
**Root Cause**: No pre-healing diagnosis to check if app was actually broken  

**Fix Applied**:
- `utils/proxyConfigAPI.js`: Added diagnostic-first approach
  - Checks if container is running
  - Tests if route responds with 2xx/3xx
  - Only applies healing if actually broken
  - Returns "already healthy" if no issues found

**Test Results**: ‚úÖ Calliope now says "already healthy" when appropriate

---

## Calliope's New Capabilities

### Knowledge Base Patterns

#### Mixed Content Errors
**Detection Signals**:
- `Mixed Content`
- `was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure`
- `This request has been blocked`
- `ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED`

**Healing Functions**:
1. `fixNginxAbsoluteRedirects()` - Adds `absolute_redirect off;` to nginx
2. `fixXForwardedProto(route)` - Sets `X-Forwarded-Proto` to `"https"`
3. `runMixedContentTest(url)` - Verifies fix with browser test

---

#### Redirect Loop Errors
**Detection Signals**:
- `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`
- `too many redirects`
- `redirect loop`
- `308 Permanent Redirect.*/_next`

**Healing Functions**:
1. `fixRedirectLoop(route)` - Fixes `proxy_pass` configuration
   - Removes trailing paths from proxy_pass
   - Converts regex locations to prefix locations
   - Regenerates nginx bundle
   - Reloads nginx

---

### System Prompt Updates

Calliope now has **IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL**:

```
When you see errors:
1. Acknowledge: "I see [issue]! Let me fix that right now üîß"
2. ACT IMMEDIATELY: Execute healing functions
3. Then explain briefly what you did
4. Offer to audit to verify
```

**WRONG** ‚ùå: "Here's how I'll fix it: 1. I'll ensure... 2. I'll make sure..."  
**RIGHT** ‚úÖ: "‚úÖ Fixed! I applied these fixes: [list actual changes made]"

---

### Diagnostic-First Approach

Before applying any healing, Calliope now:
1. Checks if container is running (docker ps)
2. Tests if route responds (HTTP HEAD request)
3. Returns early if already healthy
4. Identifies if issue is app-related vs proxy-related

**Benefits**:
- No unnecessary healing on healthy apps
- Clear diagnosis of container vs proxy issues
- Better user guidance ("start the container" vs "proxy fixed")

---

## Test Results

### Mixed Content Test
```bash
node test/mixed-content-test.js
```

**Results**:
```
/lyra Results:
  Mixed Content Errors: 0 ‚úÖ
  Mixed Content Warnings: 0 ‚úÖ
  HTTP Requests: 0 ‚úÖ
  HTTPS Requests: 39 ‚úÖ

‚úÖ TEST PASSED - No Mixed Content issues!
```

### Assets Loading Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/lyra/_next/static/chunks/webpack.js
```

**Results**:
- Status: 200 ‚úÖ
- Size: 56,355 bytes ‚úÖ
- No redirects ‚úÖ

### Calliope Diagnostic Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "/lyra is hurting. please heal it"}'
```

**Results**:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "answer": "‚úÖ Good news! /lyra is already healthy!\n\nDiagnosis:\n- Container: Running ‚úì\n- Route: 200 OK ‚úì\n- Proxy: Working ‚úì\n\nNo healing needed."
}
```

## Key Principles Learned

### 1. Actions Before Words
AI assistants should execute actions in the backend, not just describe them in responses. This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Fixes are actually applied
- ‚úÖ Deterministic behavior
- ‚úÖ No false promises
- ‚úÖ Immediate results

### 2. Diagnose Before Healing
Always check if something is actually broken before trying to fix it:
- ‚úÖ Prevents unnecessary changes
- ‚úÖ Provides clear diagnosis
- ‚úÖ Guides user to root cause
- ‚úÖ Saves time

### 3. Regenerate Nginx Bundle
After modifying `apps/*.conf` files, ALWAYS:
```bash
node utils/generateAppsBundle.js
docker exec dev-proxy nginx -s reload
```

Otherwise nginx won't pick up the changes!

### 4. Test with Browser, Not Just curl
Browser tests catch issues that curl doesn't:
- Mixed content errors (blocked by browser security)
- Redirect loops (browser follows redirects)
- Console errors (only visible in browser)
- Asset loading failures

## How to Use Calliope Now

### Reporting Issues
Just describe the problem in natural language:
- "I'm getting mixed content errors"
- "/lyra has redirect loops"
- "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS on /_next/"
- "/lyra is hurting. please heal it"

### Calliope's Response Pattern
1. **Diagnostic**: "Diagnosing /lyra first..."
2. **Action**: "‚úÖ Fixed! I applied these fixes: [list]"
3. **Offer**: "Would you like me to audit to verify?"

### If Already Healthy
Calliope will respond:
```
‚úÖ Good news! /lyra is already healthy!

Diagnosis:
- Container: Running ‚úì
- Route: 200 OK ‚úì
- Proxy: Working ‚úì

No healing needed. If you're seeing issues in your browser, try:
1. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for client-side errors
```

---

## Remaining Recommendations

### 1. Site Auditor Timeout Issues
The site auditor is timing out after 30s. Consider:
- Increasing timeout to 60s
- Using `--waitUntil networkidle2` instead of `--waitUntil load`
- Investigating why /lyra takes so long to load initially

### 2. Calliope UI Interaction
The UI interaction test needs work. The backend healing works, but triggering it through the UI might need:
- Better intent detection in the `POST /api/ai/ask` endpoint
- Integration with the advanced-heal endpoint

### 3. Pattern Detection Enhancement
Consider adding more patterns to Calliope's knowledge base:
- CORS errors
- 502 Bad Gateway (upstream issues)
- 404 errors for static assets
- WebSocket connection failures

## Verification Commands

### Check Calliope's Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/ai/health
```

### Test Mixed Content Fix
```bash
node test/mixed-content-test.js
```

### Ask Calliope to Diagnose
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "/lyra is hurting. please heal it"}'
```

### Manual Redirect Loop Test
```bash
# Should return 200, not 308
curl -I http://localhost:8080/lyra/_next/static/chunks/webpack.js
```
