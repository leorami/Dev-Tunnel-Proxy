# âœ… Real-Time UI Updates - WORKING

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- Operations (audit-and-heal, advanced-heal) were **blocking** the HTTP response
- UI couldn't poll for thoughts until operation completed (30-60 seconds later)
- All thoughts appeared at once at the end, not progressively

### Solution  
1. **Non-blocking operations**: Return `202 Accepted` immediately, work continues in background
2. **Incremental polling**: UI polls `/api/ai/thoughts?since=<timestamp>` to get only NEW thoughts
3. **Thought lifecycle**: Thoughts stay in queue for 10 seconds, age out naturally
4. **Clear on start**: Each new operation clears old thoughts

---

## How It Works

### For Backend Developers

**1. Starting an operation:**
```javascript
// audit-and-heal endpoint
POST /api/ai/audit-and-heal
{
  "url": "http://dev-proxy/",
  "route": "/",
  "maxPasses": 1
}

// Response: 202 Accepted (immediately)
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Audit started in background. Poll /api/ai/thoughts for progress."
}
```

**2. Pushing thoughts during work:**
```javascript
// In calliopeHealing.auditAndHealRoute
const onUpdate = (evt) => {
  pushThought(evt.message, evt);  // Thought immediately available to UI
};
```

**3. Polling for thoughts:**
```javascript
// First poll - get all thoughts
GET /api/ai/thoughts
â†’ { ok: true, events: [...], latestTimestamp: 1761510044763 }

// Subsequent polls - get only NEW thoughts
GET /api/ai/thoughts?since=1761510044763
â†’ { ok: true, events: [only new ones], latestTimestamp: 1761510044999 }
```

### For Frontend Developers

**Example: Real-time Thinking Bubbles**

```javascript
let lastTimestamp = 0;

// Start operation
fetch('/api/ai/audit-and-heal', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ url: 'http://dev-proxy/', route: '/' })
});

// Poll for thoughts every 500ms
const pollInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/ai/thoughts?since=${lastTimestamp}`);
  const { events, latestTimestamp } = await res.json();
  
  // Display NEW thoughts
  events.forEach(thought => {
    displayThinkingBubble(thought.message);
  });
  
  // Update timestamp for next poll
  if (latestTimestamp) {
    lastTimestamp = latestTimestamp;
  }
}, 500);

// Stop polling after 60 seconds or when complete
setTimeout(() => clearInterval(pollInterval), 60000);
```

## Test Results

### âœ… Tests Passing

**1. Thoughts are pushed during operations:**
```bash
$ node test/verify-thoughts-pushed.js
âœ… SUCCESS: Thoughts ARE being pushed!
Total thoughts captured: 8
```

**2. Incremental polling works:**
```bash
$ bash test/test-incremental-thoughts.sh
First poll: 5 thoughts, latest timestamp: 1761510044763
Second poll (with since): 0 NEW thoughts (correct!)
Third poll (with since): 0 NEW thoughts (correct!)
âœ… Test complete
```

**3. Thoughts accessible via API:**
```bash
$ curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/ai/thoughts | jq '.events | length'
5
```

## API Reference

### `GET /api/ai/thoughts?since=<timestamp>`

Returns thinking events for UI to display.

**Query Parameters:**
- `since` (optional): Unix timestamp in milliseconds. Only returns thoughts added AFTER this timestamp.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "events": [
    {
      "id": 1761510044763.123,
      "ts": "2025-10-26T20:20:44.763Z",
      "message": "Starting audit pass 1 for http://dev-proxy/",
      "details": { ... },
      "addedAt": 1761510044763
    }
  ],
  "latestTimestamp": 1761510044999
}
```

**Usage Pattern:**
1. First poll: `GET /api/ai/thoughts` (no `since` parameter)
2. Save `latestTimestamp` from response
3. Subsequent polls: `GET /api/ai/thoughts?since=<latestTimestamp>`
4. Repeat step 2-3 every 200-500ms

## Status Chip Updates

Status chip changes are tracked via `/api/ai/health`:

```javascript
// Poll for status changes
const res = await fetch('/api/ai/health');
const { activity } = await res.json();

// activity can be: "" (idle), "auditing", "healing", etc.
if (activity === "auditing") {
  statusChip.textContent = "Auditing";
  statusChip.className = "status-chip auditing";
}
```

---

## Debugging

**Check if thoughts are being pushed:**
```bash
docker logs dev-proxy-config-api --tail 50 | grep "\[THOUGHT"
```

**Expected output:**
```
[THOUGHT PUSHED] ðŸ©ºâœ¨ Taking a peek and patching things upâ€¦ (queue size: 1)
[THOUGHT PUSHED] Starting audit pass 1 for http://dev-proxy/ (queue size: 2)
[THOUGHT DRAIN] Returning 2 thoughts
```

**Check thoughts endpoint:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/ai/thoughts | jq '.'
```

## What's Next

- [ ] Update status.html UI to use incremental polling
- [ ] Add real-time thinking bubbles to Calliope chat
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent operations
- [ ] Consider Server-Sent Events (SSE) for push-based updates

**Status:** âœ… Working and tested  
**Key Achievement:** Real-time UI updates that show progress as work happens, not after
