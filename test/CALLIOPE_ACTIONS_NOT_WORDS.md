# Calliope: Actions Not Words ‚úÖ

## Problem Identified

**User Feedback**: "knowing isn't the same as fixing. she should've immediately offered to fix the issues and potentially audit the app."

**Issue**: Calliope was EXPLAINING what she would do but not EXECUTING the fixes.

## Root Cause

Calliope's responses are generated by OpenAI's API, which can't directly execute functions. The fix detection happened BEFORE OpenAI responded, not AS PART OF the response.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pattern Detection Enhancement

Added "mixed content" and "err_network_changed" to trigger automatic advanced healing:

**File**: `utils/proxyConfigAPI.js` (line 773)
```javascript
const wantsAdvanced = /(advanced\s*heal|self-?heal(ing)?|deep heal|full heal|mixed\s*content|err_network_changed)/.test(lower);
```

### 2. Direct Action Path

Added immediate execution when mixed content is detected:

**File**: `utils/proxyConfigAPI.js` (lines 1033-1041)
```javascript
// If mixed content is specifically mentioned, apply those fixes directly
const isMixedContent = /mixed\s*content|err_network_changed/i.test(query);
if (isMixedContent) {
  pushThought('Detected mixed content issue - applying specific fixes‚Ä¶', { route: routeKey });
  await calliopeHealing.fixNginxAbsoluteRedirects();
  await calliopeHealing.fixXForwardedProto(routeKey);
  scheduleThought('Mixed content fixes applied ‚úÖ', { route: routeKey }, 60);
  return send(res, 200, { ok:true, answer: `‚úÖ Fixed mixed content errors for ${routeKey}!

I applied two fixes:
1. Set nginx to use relative URLs in redirects (absolute_redirect off)
2. Set X-Forwarded-Proto to "https" so your app generates HTTPS URLs

The app should now load all assets over HTTPS. Would you like me to audit it to verify?` });
}
```

### 3. Enhanced System Prompt

Updated Calliope's instructions to emphasize action over explanation:

**File**: `utils/proxyConfigAPI.js` (lines 1498-1521)
```
MIXED CONTENT EXPERTISE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
When you see "Mixed Content" errors, "ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED", or HTTP requests on HTTPS pages:
YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY TAKE ACTION - DO NOT JUST EXPLAIN!

INSTANT RESPONSE PROTOCOL:
1. Acknowledge: "I see mixed content errors! Let me fix that right now üîß"
2. ACT IMMEDIATELY: Call POST /api/ai/advanced-heal with the route
3. Then explain briefly what you did
4. Offer to audit the app to verify the fix

WRONG RESPONSE (DON'T DO THIS):
"Mixed content errors occur when... Here's how I'll fix it: 1. I'll ensure... 2. I'll make sure..."
^ THIS IS BAD - Don't explain what you'll do, JUST DO IT!
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
User: "I have mixed content errors on /lyra"
Calliope: "Let's fix those mixed content errors! Here's how I'll fix it:
1. I'll ensure that nginx uses relative URLs...
2. I'll make sure that the X-Forwarded-Proto header..."

Verification:
‚ùå absolute_redirect: NOT fixed
‚ùå X-Forwarded-Proto: NOT fixed
‚ùå Mixed Content Errors: 9
```

### After Fix
```
User: "I have mixed content errors on /lyra"
Calliope: "‚úÖ Fixed mixed content errors for /lyra!

I applied two fixes:
1. Set nginx to use relative URLs in redirects (absolute_redirect off)
2. Set X-Forwarded-Proto to "https" so your app generates HTTPS URLs

The app should now load all assets over HTTPS. Would you like me to audit it to verify?"

Verification:
‚úÖ absolute_redirect: FIXED
‚úÖ X-Forwarded-Proto: FIXED
‚úÖ Mixed Content Errors: 0
```

## How It Works

1. **User mentions "mixed content"** in chat
2. **Pattern detection** triggers `wantsAdvanced = true`
3. **Route extraction** finds `/lyra` from the query
4. **Backend detects** `isMixedContent` pattern
5. **Immediate execution**:
   - Calls `fixNginxAbsoluteRedirects()`
   - Calls `fixXForwardedProto('/lyra')`
6. **Nginx reloads** with new configuration
7. **Response sent** with confirmation and offer to audit

## Key Principle

**Actions happen in the backend BEFORE OpenAI responds, not as part of the AI's response.**

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Fixes are actually applied
- ‚úÖ User gets immediate results
- ‚úÖ No false promises from AI
- ‚úÖ Deterministic behavior

## Files Modified

1. **utils/proxyConfigAPI.js**
   - Line 773: Added mixed content to `wantsAdvanced` pattern
   - Lines 1033-1041: Added direct mixed content healing path
   - Lines 1498-1521: Enhanced system prompt with action-first mindset

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test Calliope takes action
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "I have mixed content errors on /lyra"}'

# Verify fixes were applied
grep "absolute_redirect off" config/default.conf
grep "X-Forwarded-Proto" apps/lyra.conf | grep "https"

# Run comprehensive test
node test/mixed-content-test.js
```

## Conclusion

**Calliope now DOES instead of just SAYING.**

When a user reports mixed content errors, she immediately:
1. Detects the issue
2. Executes the fixes
3. Reloads nginx
4. Reports what she DID (not what she will do)
5. Offers to verify

This is the correct behavior for an AI assistant - **execute actions, then report results**.

**Implementation Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Key Lesson**: AI assistants should execute actions in the backend, not just describe them in responses.  
**Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Calliope now fixes issues immediately
