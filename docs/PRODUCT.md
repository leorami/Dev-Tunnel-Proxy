## Vision

**Dev Tunnel Proxy** is a development infrastructure platform that makes microservices development feel like working on a monolith—without the coupling. It provides intelligent routing, secure tunneling, and AI-powered self-healing so teams can focus on building features instead of wrestling with infrastructure.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### Development Environment Complexity

Modern development involves:
- **Multiple services** running simultaneously
- **Different ports** to remember and manage
- **Routing conflicts** between projects
- **Tunnel management** for sharing work
- **Configuration duplication** across projects
- **Integration debugging** across service boundaries

Traditional solutions:
- ❌ Manual proxy configs (error-prone, hard to maintain)
- ❌ Port mapping chaos (app1:3000, app2:3001, app3:8080...)
- ❌ Each app configures its own tunnel (resource waste)
- ❌ No visibility into what's working or broken

### Our Approach

✅ **Single unified proxy** for all development services  
✅ **Automatic conflict detection** with clear resolution paths  
✅ **Shared ngrok tunnel** for all apps simultaneously  
✅ **Visual dashboard** showing health and routes  
✅ **AI assistant** that fixes routing issues automatically  
✅ **Configuration as code** with programmatic API

---

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Zero Configuration Overhead

**Problem**: Every new service requires proxy setup, tunnel config, route coordination

**Solution**: Apps contribute their routing needs via simple nginx snippets. Proxy composes, deconflicts, and applies automatically.

```javascript
// From within your app container
fetch('http://dev-proxy:8080/devproxy/api/apps/install', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'myapp',
    content: nginxConfig
  })
});
// → App is now routed and tunneled
```

**Value**: 5 minutes from app start to public URL, every time.

### 2. Team Collaboration Without Friction

**Problem**: Sharing localhost requires ngrok setup per developer, different URLs for each service

**Solution**: Single persistent tunnel serves all apps. One URL to share, works for entire stack.

```
https://your-team.ngrok.app/
  ├─► /myapp/     → Your app
  ├─► /app2/      → Another app
  ├─► /api/       → Shared API
  └─► /admin/     → Admin dashboard
```

**Value**: Stakeholders bookmark one URL, see all work in progress.

### 3. Intelligent Conflict Resolution

**Problem**: Multiple apps want `/api/`, unclear which should win

**Solution**: Automatic detection with visual conflict UI and programmatic resolution API.

**Value**: No more "it works on my machine" debugging.

### 4. Proactive Health Monitoring

**Problem**: Silent failures in dev environments waste hours

**Solution**: Continuous scanning + visual dashboard + Calliope alerts

**Value**: Know about problems before you encounter them.

### 5. AI-Powered Self-Healing

**Problem**: Routing bugs require nginx expertise to diagnose and fix

**Solution**: Calliope AI assistant learns common patterns and fixes them automatically

**Example Scenario**:
- React app deploys with new build
- Assets return 404 (forgot to set basePath)
- Calliope detects pattern, applies fix, verifies success
- Developer notified: "I noticed /myapp had asset 404s and fixed them! 💖"

**Value**: 80% of routing issues heal themselves.

### Why This Matters

#### Development Should Be Joyful

Infrastructure problems drain energy and creativity. Every minute spent debugging routing is a minute not spent building features. Dev Tunnel Proxy removes friction so developers can focus on what they love: building great products.

#### AI Should Empower, Not Replace

Calliope demonstrates thoughtful AI integration—she handles repetitive tasks (routing fixes) while empowering developers to understand and control their systems. She's an assistant, not a replacement.

#### Inspiration from Resilience

Named after the author's daughter who lives with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Calliope embodies resilience, empathy, and proactive problem-solving. Just as she navigates challenges with determination and care, the Calliope AI helps development environments stay healthy and productive.

If this project inspires you, consider supporting families affected by TSC through the [TSC Alliance](https://www.tscalliance.org/).
