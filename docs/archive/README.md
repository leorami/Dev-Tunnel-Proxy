# Documentation Archive

This directory contains the original documentation files that have been consolidated into the new 6-document structure (December 2025).

## What Happened?

The documentation was reorganized from 13 separate files into 6 comprehensive guides for easier navigation and reduced context switching.

## Old Files (Archived)

These files have been merged into the new documentation:

| Old File | Now Part Of | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | `USER_GUIDE.md` | Troubleshooting section |
| `DATA_LIFECYCLE.md` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Data Flow & Lifecycle section |
| `RESILIENCE.md` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Resilience & Error Handling section |
| `API-ENDPOINTS.md` | `CONFIGURATION.md` | API Endpoints section |
| `CONFIG-MANAGEMENT-GUIDE.md` | `CONFIGURATION.md` | Main content |
| `ROADMAP.md` | `PRODUCT.md` | Roadmap section |
| `TESTING.md` | `OPERATIONS.md` | Testing section |
| `SECURITY.md` | `OPERATIONS.md` | Security section |
| `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` | `OPERATIONS.md` | Known Issues section |

## New Documentation Structure

### 6 Core Guides

1. **[USER_GUIDE.md](../USER_GUIDE.md)** - Getting started, daily usage, and troubleshooting
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design, data flow, and resilience
3. **[CONFIGURATION.md](../CONFIGURATION.md)** - Configuration management and API reference
4. **[CALLIOPE.md](../CALLIOPE.md)** - AI assistant capabilities (unchanged)
5. **[PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md)** - Product vision, roadmap, and strategy
6. **[OPERATIONS.md](../OPERATIONS.md)** - Testing, security, and quality assurance

## Why the Change?

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fewer context switches between related topics
- ✅ Easier to find information (6 docs vs 13)
- ✅ Better organization by audience (users, developers, operators)
- ✅ Reduced duplication and clearer navigation
- ✅ Each document has a distinct purpose

**No information was lost** - all content has been preserved and integrated into the appropriate new documents.

## Need the Old Structure?

These archived files are kept for reference. However, we recommend using the new consolidated documentation as it contains all the same information with better organization and updated cross-references.
